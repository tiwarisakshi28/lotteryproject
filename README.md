Sure, here's a readme file for the above code:

# Lottery Smart Contract

This is a smart contract for a simple lottery game implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity programming language. The contract allows multiple players to participate in the lottery by sending a fixed amount of ether (0.1 ETH) to the contract address. The contract keeps track of all players who have participated and stores their addresses in a dynamic array.

## Prerequisites

- A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts such as Remix IDE or Truffle Suite.
- An Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask or Geth.

## Installation

1. Copy the contract code into a new Solidity file in your development environment.
2. Compile the contract code using a Solidity compiler such as Remix IDE or the command line.
3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum blockchain network of your choice such as the Ethereum Mainnet or a test network.
4. Interact with the contract using a tool such as Remix IDE or a web3.js enabled website.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice.
2. Players can participate in the lottery by sending 0.1 ETH to the contract address.
3. The contract manager can call the `pickWinner()` function to randomly select a winner from the list of players who have participated.
4. The winner will receive the entire balance of the contract.
5. The contract manager can also call the `getBalance()` function to check the current balance of the contract.
